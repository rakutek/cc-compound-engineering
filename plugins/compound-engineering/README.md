### Context7

**Tools provided:**
- `resolve-library-id` - Find library ID for a framework/package
- `get-library-docs` - Get documentation for a specific library

Supports 100+ frameworks including Rails, React, Next.js, Vue, Django, Laravel, and more.

MCP servers start automatically when the plugin is enabled.

## Installation

```bash
claude /plugin install compound-engineering
```

## Known Issues

### MCP Server Not Auto-Loading

**Issue:** The bundled MCP server (Context7) may not load automatically when the plugin is installed.

**Workaround:** Manually add it to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Or add it globally in `~/.claude/settings.json` for all projects.
